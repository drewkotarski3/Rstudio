## Exercises

### Exercise 1

``` r
college_recent_grads %>% 
  arrange(desc(total))  %>%
  count(women, major, total) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 173 x 4
    ##    women major                                       total     n
    ##    <int> <chr>                                       <int> <int>
    ##  1     0 Military Technologies                         124     1
    ##  2    77 Mining And Mineral Engineering                756     1
    ##  3   109 Mathematics And Computer Science              609     1
    ##  4   131 Metallurgical Engineering                     856     1
    ##  5   135 Naval Architecture And Marine Engineering    1258     1
    ##  6   209 Soil Science                                  685     1
    ##  7   232 Geological And Geophysical Engineering        720     1
    ##  8   271 Court Reporting                              1148     1
    ##  9   282 Petroleum Engineering                        2339     1
    ## 10   371 Mechanical Engineering Related Technologies  4790     1

Remove this text, and add your answer for Exercise 1 here. Add code
chunks as needed. Don’t forget to label your code chunk. Do not use
spaces in code chunk labels.

### Exercise 2

We choose the median instead of the mean to display income because the
median is not affected by high or low outliers.

### Exercise 3

``` r
ggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000)
```

![](hw-04_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Binwidth is the better choice. The binwidth arguement controls the size
of each bin on the x axis. The more the bin the wider each interval
becomes. The 5000 binwidth is better visually as well as having a more
clear x and y axis

### Exercise 4

…

``` r
college_recent_grads %>%
  summarise(min = min(median), max = max(median),
            mean = mean(median), med = median(median),
            sd = sd(median), 
            q1 = quantile(median, probs = 0.25),
            q3 = quantile(median, probs = 0.75))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 7
    ##     min    max   mean   med     sd    q1    q3
    ##   <dbl>  <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 22000 110000 40151. 36000 11470. 33000 45000

The summary stats that would be the must useful in describing the
distrobution of the histogram would be Q1 and Q3 as well as the median
and SD. \#\#\# Exercise 5

``` r
ggplot(data = college_recent_grads, mapping = aes(x = median)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000)+ 
  facet_wrap(~major_category )
