## Ex 8

Do you think that the levels of COVID found in wastewater are a good
indicator of the burden of COVID in the community? Explain.

Yes I think that the levels of COVID found in waste water are a good
indicator of the burden of Covid within the community because the
relation between the data of waste water and the data of covid cases.
The graphs above show an almost exact relationship between amount of
cases within the community and the amount of rna in waste water within
the community. showing
